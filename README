Mongrel2 C handler example code.

I am trying to bridge a C-only library into the jsocket/websocket world and I thought this could be useful to others.

== Prequisites ==

mongrel2 installed and configured to your liking (see my deployment example to get going, config.sh and start.sh help out)
http://www.mongrel2.org/

peg/leg

== Parsing Incoming Requests ==
Mongrel2 uses lemon but I don't know jack about how to use those. But I have used treetop for ruby, so let's peg it! peg/leg is a C-code generator that uses a similar rule format to treetop. Let's see if I can use that.

Feel free to send me a message through github. Patches are welcome!
