How Messages From Mongrel2 Are Parsed
-------------------------------------

Mongrel talks to handlers use `zmq_msg_t`'s.
You will be sending and receiving these over the course of your task.
A `zmq_msg_t` has a opaque data field where your webserver-related info comes in
-- you must parse the data field according the to the mongrel2 format (aka, a protocol on top of zmq).

My C handler will parse for you and return a `mongrel2_request_t`. This has all the info you'll need to get going.

Fields that may need explanation:

* `UUID`: The name of the mongrel2 instance that will be helping you out today. 128 bit number in hex with '`-`' thrown in. Always 36 characters.
* `CONN_ID`: Requests get an ID, a token to keep you and mongrel on the same page. Monotonic, always increasing int starts from 0.
* `PATH`: URL you know and love.
* `HEADERS`: JSON object (aka, a dictionary)
* `BODY`: An opaque buffer

How data looks coming in from Mongrel2
--------------------------------------

Spaces and commas are literal elements of the protocol. ZMQ message format for incoming requests:

    UUID CONN_ID PATH HEADER_NETSTRING,BODY_NETSTRING,

Netstrings are defined as:

    STRINGIFIED_LENGTH_OF_DATA:DATA

I `sscanf` the length into a `uint32_t`, allocate a buffer of that size, and put `opaque_data` into it.

As my friend David says, they're like ASN.1 but easier.

How data looks going back to Mongrel2
-------------------------------------

Simpler than parsing the message.

* `STR_CONN_LIST`: 1-128 `CONN_ID`(s) seperated by a space. Example: `"0 2 3"`
* `STR_CONN_LIST_LENGTH`: The number of bytes, not entries, in the list. For `STR_CONN_LIST` example: `5`
* `CONN_NETSTRING`: Expands as `"STR_CONN_LIST_LENGTH:STR_CONN_LIST"`, where '`:`' is literal.
* `OPAQUE_RESPONSE`: Whatever you want, mongrel won't touch it

High level description of the byte stream

    UUID CONN_NETSTRING, OPAQUE_RESPONSE

Reason for a `CONN_NETSTRING`: Allow a single handler message to go to multiple clients. Web multicast made easy? Dunno, could be handy with websocket-y stuff.

How disconnection works
-----------------------

Disconnects are remote commands to mongrel2 saying, Hey, close that socket would ya? It is a special case of sending data to mongrel2 it's just that you send no data. Mongrel2 will interpret the empty payload as a `CLOSE` request. Don't forget the trailing space!

    UUID CONN_NETSTRING,
